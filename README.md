This repository provides the complete experimental dataset used for developing and validating the proposed SOC estimation framework using Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) and short-period sine-wave pulse (COS) excitation. All tests were performed on commercial 26650 cylindrical LiFePO₄ (LFP) cells and collected using Arbin LBT21024 battery cyclers, Gamry electrochemical workstations, and an AMEREX IC500R thermal chamber at the Stanford Energy Control Laboratory.
